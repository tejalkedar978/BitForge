Low interest rates across many regions have made borrowing more affordable, encouraging consumers to take out loans for a wide variety of purposes such as home renovation, education, and emergency expenses.

In particular, millennials and Gen Z consumers are increasingly turning to personal loans, credit cards, and auto loans to manage their financial needs.</p> <p>Technological advancements also play a major role in transforming the landscape of consumer loans. Digital lending platforms, including peer-to-peer lending and fintech-driven solutions, have made it easier for consumers to apply for and receive loans with minimal paperwork and faster processing times. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are helping lenders to better assess credit risk, allowing for more personalized loan offerings that cater to the specific needs of borrowers. This trend is likely to enhance market growth as it reduces operational costs for lenders and improves the borrower experience.</p> <p>Moreover, the increasing popularity of buy now, pay later (BNPL) services and the growing acceptance of alternative credit scoring models are also contributing to the expanding consumer loans market.
